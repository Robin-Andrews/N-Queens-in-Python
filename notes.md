# N-Queens

Check out using get_coords_from_grid() and get grid_from_coords() and/or implementing myself

An implementation of the classic N-Queens Problem using  codeskulptor or SimpleGUICS2Pygame

If submitted to Codereview stackexchange, include working codeskulptor URLs including imports. Mention weird bug where running a second time breaks the program in CS, but not the third, fifth time etc.

Add sound effects
