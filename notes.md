# N-Queens

An implementation of the classic N-Queens Problem using  codeskulptor or SimpleGUICS2Pygame

If submitted to Codereview stackexchange, include working codeskulptor URLs including imports. Mention weird bug where running a second time breaks the program in CS, but not the third, fifth time etc.
